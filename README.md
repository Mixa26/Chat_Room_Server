# Chat_Room_Server
A chat server where multiple clients can communicate.

There is a chat history on the server which saves the last 100 messages, when new clients join they have to make unique usernames.
There is also a simple censored word implementation which can be expanded. If a word is detected to be censored it is chained like
(parolaccia => p********a).
